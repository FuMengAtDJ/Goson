Goson uses the Gosu Open Type System to create first-class Gosu types from a JSON file. Just place a sample
JSON file in your project, and Goson will creates types from it. The package is currently derived from
the name of the file. 
For instance,
twitter.status.Response.json will create a package of json.twitter.status. "Response" will be used as
the name of the top level object in the JSON file. The type of each property in the JSON is determined
by how it is presented - "ok" will be a String, 0.0 will be a double, 1 will be an int, and a nested object
will create a new type based off of the name of the property. All property names are Gosu-ized, so some_name
becomes SomeName.

TODO
parsed json has raw ArrayList instead of genericized
