Goson uses the Gosu Open Type System to create first-class Gosu types from a jschema. Just place a sample
jschema in your project, and Goson will creates types from it. The package is currently derived from the directory structure.
For an example, see src/jschema/google/geocode/GeocodeResponse.jsc
Since the root of a JSON Object has no name, the name of the file is used as the top level type.

To use GeocodeResponse, it would be:

uses jschema.google.geocode.GeocodeResponse

var geocode = GeocodeResponse.parse(new java.net.URL("http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&sensor=false"))
print(geocode.Status)
