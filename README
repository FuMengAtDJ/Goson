playing around with Gosu typeloading - creating a JSON typeloader that loads based off of a 
sample JSON file. 

Right now it's loading from hard-coded files, and still working on changing names
to be more gosu-like for properties, and changing type names to the proper casing.

Creates types for all levels of the JSON. Currently does not fully handle json arrays. Can only
handle JSON arrays that are all of ones type. Seems to be pretty standard, even in the RFC.
