playing around with Gosu typeloading - creating a JSON typeloader that loads based off of a 
sample JSON file. right now it's loading from hard-coded files, and still working on changing names
to be more gosu-like for properties, and changing type names to the proper casing. also need to handle
json arrays and types besides strings.
